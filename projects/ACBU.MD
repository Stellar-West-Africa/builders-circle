# Stellar Payment Gateway

**Builder(s)**: [JUNMAN SAM](https://github.com/Junman140)

**Status**: In Development

**Description**:ACBU is a stablecoin backed by a basket of African currencies, designed to address currency stability, cross-border payments, and financial inclusion across the continent. Unlike USD-pegged stablecoins, ACBU's value is tied to a weighted basket of 10 African currencies, providing a "continental currency" for intra-African trade and remittances.
